### The approach
The goal of this curriculum is to teach computer science concepts through playing and analysis of board games. There are two curriculums. One focuses on gaining problem-solving skills and understanding Representations, Algorithms, and Computation (Not Programming). The second curriculum aims for deeper understanding about concepts mentioned previously -- the concepts are applied to programming. Additionally, the second curriculum is meant to provide problem-solving skills.


### About
Childsplay contains supplemental information related to the development of curriculum and tools
for BoGL. Work for this project has been funded by an NSF grant obtained by the [School of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/).
