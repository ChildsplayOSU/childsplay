### Jennifer Parham-Mocello

Jennifer Parham-Mocello fell in love with computer science while pursuing an undergraduate degree in secondary math education. Since then, her focus turned to computer science education. Immediately after obtaining her bachelor’s in computer science, she became an adjunct instructor at a community college. She subsequently pursued a master’s in computer science, which sparked her interest in how people learn computer science, the best ways to teach computer science, and the higher-order/logical thinking skills needed for computer science. She returned to school for a doctorate focusing on how people solve problems in computer science. Her mission is to improve computer science education through exploratory research and empirical evidence, best teaching practices, and community efforts supporting computational literacy for all.

### Margaret Neiss

Margaret (Maggie) L. Niess is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics Education at Oregon State University.  Her research focuses on the knowledge teachers rely on for integrating technologies in their teaching -Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge, often referred to as TPACK. She has authored multiple peer-reviewed journals and chapter including multiple teacher preparation books. She directed the design, implementation, and evaluation of an online Master of Science program for K-12 mathematics and science teacher with an interdisciplinary science mathematics, and technology emphasis. Her research from this program explores the effectiveness of social metacognitive constructivist learning trajectory in online graduate coursework. She has been an editor of multiple Handbooks of Research for IGI Global.  She has chaired multiple committees for the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (AMTE) and has served as chair for the American Educational Research Association’s (AERA) SIG-TACTL (Technology as  a Change Agent in Teaching and Learning).
