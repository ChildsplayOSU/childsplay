### Jennifer Parham-Mocello

Jennifer Parham-Mocello fell in love with computer science while pursuing an undergraduate degree in secondary math education. Since then, her focus turned to computer science education. Immediately after obtaining her bachelor’s in computer science, she became an adjunct instructor at a community college. She subsequently pursued a master’s in computer science, which sparked her interest in how people learn computer science, the best ways to teach computer science, and the higher-order/logical thinking skills needed for computer science. She returned to school for a doctorate focusing on how people solve problems in computer science. Her mission is to improve computer science education through exploratory research and empirical evidence, best teaching practices, and community efforts supporting computational literacy for all.

### Margaret Neiss

Margaret (Maggie) L. Niess is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics Education at Oregon State University.  Her research focuses on the knowledge teachers rely on for teaching -Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge, often referred to as TPACK. She has authored multiple peer-reviewed journals and chapters including teacher preparation books. Her most recent book is Blended Online Learning and Instructional Design for TPACK: Emerging Research and Opportunities (2019). She has been editor of multiple Handbooks of Research for IGI Global, the most recent being Handbook of Research on Transforming Teachers’ Online Pedagogical Reasoning for Engaging K-12 Students in Virtual Learning (2021). Her research has identified an online learning trajectory for framing student-centered instructional strategies using a social metacognitive constructivist context. In 2014 she awarded the George G. Mallison Distinguished Service Award for the School Science and Mathematics Association. In 2015 her article in the Journal of Digital Learning in Teacher Education was awarded article of the year. She has chaired multiple committees for the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (AMTE) and has served as chair for the American Educational Research Association’s (AERA) SIG-TACTL (Technology as  a Change Agent in Teaching and Learning).
