### An Unplugged Example

One of the topics we cover in our unplugged curriculum is the game of Tic Tac Toe. This makes a great example to get students thinking about computer science, but in a way that's familiar and fun for them. We start by talking about a very abstract idea of what Tic Tac Toe is. This helps to challenge what students already know about the game, and connect it the important CS concepts we want to teach. You can see our initial presentation of tic tac toe below.

We represent the board as a treasure map, which has various chests on it, and ropes across the map. Students work through activities such as this to help connect their existing enjoyment and understanding of games to computer science.

### Unit 1 Preview

Ben: I have questions for this before I start writing this in.
- Is this a preview of Unit 1 for 6th or 7th grade?
- Is this a preview of the entire unit, or just a day (or 2)
- Do you want this to be:
  - a summary of the coversheet(s)?
  - a general walkthrough of what is covered?
