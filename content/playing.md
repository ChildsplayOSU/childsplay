Focused on problem solving-skills and understanding Representations, Algorithms, and Computation.

### About

The Unplugged curriculum aims to teach concepts of computer science *without* a programming
language. The main concepts taught are: representation, abstraction, algorithms, input, output,
instructions, conditions, types, names, values, computation, computer, resources, and bindings.

### An Unplugged Example

One of the topics we cover in our unplugged curriculum is the game of Tic Tac Toe. This makes a great example to get students thinking about computer science, but in a way that's familiar and fun for them. We start by talking about a very abstract idea of what Tic Tac Toe is. This helps to challenge what students already know about the game, and connect it the important CS concepts we want to teach. You can see our initial presentation of tic tac toe below.

We represent the board as a treasure map, which has various chests on it, and ropes across the map. Students work through activities such as this to help connect their existing enjoyment and understanding of games to computer science.
